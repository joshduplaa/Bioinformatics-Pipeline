# Bioinformatics-Pipeline
A pipeline that: Gathers and sorts sequences of DNA or Protein -> Finds representative sequences and builds the clusters for each representative sequence -> Filters out clusters with representative sequences that are Chimeric sequences -> Perform multiple sequence alignment(MSA) on the non-chimeric sequences
